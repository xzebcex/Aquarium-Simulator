# Aquarium Simulator
This application creates a virtual aquarium complete with fish, kelp, and bubbles. The fish swim around aimlessly, changing direction and speed on a regular basis. Bubbles are produced by bubblers put in the tank, whereas kelp is immobile and ornamental.

1.	NUM_KELP: the kelp count in the aquarium
2.	NUM_FISH: the aquarium's fish population
3.	NUM_BUBBLERS: the quantity of bubblers in the aquarium
4.	FRAMES_PER_SECOND: the simulation's frame rate, expressed in frames per second
5.	At the command line, hit Ctrl-C to exit the script.
## Add a License
The MIT License applies to this code.


## How to Contribute
It is encouraged to make improvements to the code. The program greatly appreciates contributions. Although this application is fully working, code contributions are always appreciated.

## Additional points
1.	The fish in the tank wander around at random, changing direction and pace on a regular basis.
2.	Kelp is immobile and beautiful, whereas bubbles are produced in the aquarium by bubblers.
3.	The application displays an aquarium with a dark backdrop with fish and bubbles in various colors.
4.	You may change the variables in the code to alter the simulation.
5.	This program was developed using Python3.
## Conclusion
This application simulates a small aquarium with fish, kelp, and bubbles. It may be tweaked to adjust the amount of fish, kelp, and bubblers in the aquarium, as well as the simulation's pace.
